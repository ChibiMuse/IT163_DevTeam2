# Meeting Notes for Sunday May 9th, 2021

## Sprint 1 Review - Spring 2 Overview

Kelly finished 3 wireframe options. We picked option 2 (with the logo and nav on the same vertical line with a header of contrasting color to the main page).
Jordan will transform his events page vision into a wireframe.
Megan will get our basic template/code base framework set up.

By our next meeting (5/12 @ 7PM), wireframes will be completed and code base set-up. By next Sunday, we hope to have a prototype up and ready.

This week is also design/color/typeface week. Jordan and Megan will send any palette or design inspo to Kelly.

### Next Meeting Wednesday, 5/12 @ 7
