## Project Overview
Project Available at GitHub: https://github.com/ChibiMuse/IT163_DevTeam2
Visual Design/Wireframes for comparison: https://www.figma.com/file/UwCpj5lqdR9M5ri3kVpLXt/it163-Spr-21--Final-Website---Hill%2C-Smith%2C-Lui?node-id=92%3A93

Scope: We designed an organization site to inform the public about a group of technically skilled individuals who use their tech skills for projects to help their communities. Focus is on education and outreach.
The user can engage with members, ask questions, access resources, locate upcoming events, etc. Project meets HTML and CSS requirements and includes the following Javascript requirements:
- toggle for theme colors that stays w/ the user throughout the session (no matter the page)
- timer for page
- a 1 in 10 chance of being invited to register for the next event on the main page.
- a fillable and validated contact form
- an interactive calendar
- geolocation.

In the end, we surprised ourselves and created a website that managed to match our visual design and should mark off all functional requirements according to spec.
We each had varying experiences and grew in our understanding of Figma, GitHub/git, Bootstrap, Javascript and communication/working together as a team.
We had a couple set-backs of varying magnitudes of difficulty, but while we lost time, in the end we gained more experience and learning opportunities and still achieved our goals.
